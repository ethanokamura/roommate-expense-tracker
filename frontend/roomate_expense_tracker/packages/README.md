# Packages Directory

The **packages** directory contains the backend and core functionality of the project. It is responsible for handling API calls, database interactions, reusable UI components, and essential app libraries.  

This directory ensures a clean separation of concerns by organizing the project's logic, data management, and utility functions separately from the UI, which is built using Cubits in the `lib` directory.

## Structure
```
packages/
  â”œâ”€â”€ api_client/         # Manages API interactions and network requests 
  â”œâ”€â”€ app_core/           # Core functionalities and foundational backend logic 
  â”œâ”€â”€ app_ui/             # Common UI components, theming, and constants 
  â”œâ”€â”€ winery_repository/  # Winery-related data management and API/database interactions 
  â””â”€â”€ user_repository/    # User-related data management and API/database interactions
```

## Directory Breakdown

### `api_client/`
- Provides networking capabilities for the app.
- Contains API service classes and HTTP request handlers.

### `app_core/`
- The backbone of the project, managing core functionalities.
- May include dependency injection, configuration settings, and shared utilities.

### `app_ui/`
- Holds reusable UI elements, including:
  - **Themes & styles** â€“ Defines the appâ€™s color scheme and typography.
  - **Widgets** â€“ Commonly used UI components.
  - **Constants** â€“ Shared values such as spacing, dimensions, and assets.

### `winery_repository/`
- Manages winery-related data, including:
  - Fetching and storing winery details.
  - Handling winery-specific API calls and database interactions.

### `user_repository/`
- Manages user data, including:
  - Authentication and user profile management.
  - API calls and local database storage related to users.

This structure keeps the business logic modular, reusable, and scalable. By separating the data and backend logic from the UI, the project remains well-organized and easier to maintain. ðŸš€
