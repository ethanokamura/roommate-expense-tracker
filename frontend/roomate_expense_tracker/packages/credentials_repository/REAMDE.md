# Insights Repository

This repository provides the core logic and data interactions for the **`Insights`** domain within our application. It acts as an abstraction layer, handling all necessary communication with our backend services and the **Athena database** to manage `Insights`-related data.

By centralizing `GET` methods and other data operations here, we ensure a consistent and robust approach to data retrieval and manipulation for `Insights`.

---

## Key Responsibilities

* **Data Abstraction:** Isolates the frontend (via Cubits) from the complexities of direct API calls and database interactions.
* **Athena Database Interaction:** Leverages our custom **Athena SDK** to fetch and manage data related to `Insights`.
* **Backend Communication:** Primarily handles `GET` requests to our NodeJS backend, ensuring efficient data retrieval.
* **Error Handling:** Defines specific **failures** for `Insights` operations, allowing for robust error management in the frontend.

## Core Components

This package defines the following publicly accessible classes and their associated functionality:

- **Insights**: Represents the data model for `Insights`. This is your primary entity for this domain.

These models are the building blocks for how `Insights` data is structured and used throughout the application.

## Usage

To use this repository in the main Flutter application:

1.  Add it to the main `pubspec.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
        insights_repository:
            path: packages/insights_repository
    ```
2.  Run `flutter pub get`
3.  Inject the `InsightsRepository()` into Cubits or other service layers.
4.  **Access methods** like `fetchInsights()`, `fetchInsightsWithId(id)`, etc., to interact with `Insights` data.
